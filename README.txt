# DSSSSA

Made by DS and cx384.

For the 2022 Minetest GAME JAM.

This is not a finished game so don't expect too much.

A hint if you actually want to play this game. Don't put your rocks into the GPU, it is a wast of rocks. Instead gather all 8 types of different rocks and put them at the same time into your CPU. I think this could work, maybe. Oh and don't forget to toggle your handbreak.
